**If you are using a _Text Completion_ profile, make sure your profile contains API, preset, model, and instruct.**

**If you are using a _Chat Completion_ profile; API, settings, model would be enough.**

## FAQ

>I'm having API error.

Your API/model might not support structured output. Change `Prompt Engineering` mode from `Native API` to `JSON` or `XML`.

> What is the difference compared to [famous tracker](https://github.com/kaldigo/SillyTavern-Tracker)?

Most importantly, it works. This is a minimalistic version of the original tracker.
- No annoying connection profile switch. (This is the reason why I created this extension in the first place.)
- No "Prompt Maker" option. Because JSON schema is easy enough to edit.
- No "Generation Target" option. (Could be added in the future)
- No "Generation Mode" option. Since this extension doesn't summarize the chat, no need for it. (I'm not planning to add a summarize feature.)
- There are some templates in the original, but I don't need them since I don't have those features.
